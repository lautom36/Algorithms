This project is designed to help you decide what role you enjoy the most in Overwatch 2.

To get started, run the file.

If you have played less than 100 games using this program your going to be asked if you
  want to reset the data.

After that you will be prompted with a role to play and asked to input your happiness gained
  from that game. This happiness is on a scale of one to ten, and is your idea of how well you
  played and how enjoyable the game was.

Next you will be asked if you want to play another game and the cycle repeats.

If you have played more than 100 games you will be asked if you want to see how many games you
  should play in a session. This is determined by looking at all the sessions played after 100
  games (this is to make sure that the role selection has had time to figure out what you like).
  To test this you can take the data in testData.json and copy that into data.json.
